This is my awersome research on virtual environments. The article is available at doi:10.1111/1000-7 
You can easily reproduce my results by running scripts locally.
Please cite me!

# Running the script:
##### System Specs: Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043 Python 3.10 + pip (latest version)
#### Instructions:
1. Open command line (Win+R and type "cmd" in search window) 
2. Load these packages with pip:
`pip install google`
`pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`
`pip install kivy`
`pip install biopython (for module Bio)`
`pip install iohttp`
`pip install pandas`
`pip install scipy`
`pip install scanpy`
`pip install opencv` 
(for module cv2)
`pip install lxml`
(for BeautifulSoup("", "lxml") to work properly)
3. Now you are beatiful and can run the script via command line:
`disk\path\to\script\pain.py`
